## [ICN-Enabled Secure Edge Networking with Augmented Reality (ICE-AR)](http://ice-ar.named-data.net)

- NSF/Intel joint program (06/2017-05/2020)
- Collaboration with UCLA and New Mexico State

Enable authoring and experience of rich augmented reality (AR) using NDN to leverage high performance wireless technology and edge computing capabilities, and to support expressive and realistic trust mechanisms. 

## [Building the Core NDN Infrastructure to Advance Information-Centric Networking Research](https://named-data.net)

- NSF (09/2016-08/2019)
- Collaboration with UCLA, University of Arizona, University of Memphis, Washington University in St. Louis

This effort aims to build the core infrastructure to support the evaluation, experimentation, and further development of the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture as a community resource, serving to advance researches in the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm.
