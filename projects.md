- **Named Data Networking for 5G C-V2X**

    The project aims to initiate exploration of 5G C-V2X/NDN technology pair by creating a comprehensive simulation package (and potentially real application prototype) to demonstrate capabilities under various realistic network and road conditions.

- **[FABRIC: Fabric is Adaptive programmaBle Research Infrastructure for Computer science](https://whatisfabric.net)**

    Experimentations of NDN architecture evaluation using FABRIC infrastructure, as well as design, support, and drive experiments of NDN support for augmented reality (AR) on mobile devices using FABRIC edge cloud for infusing end- to-end security and identity and privacy protection throughout the network.

- **[ICN-Enabled Secure Edge Networking with Augmented Reality (ICE-AR)](http://ice-ar.named-data.net)**
